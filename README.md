# The_Fruit_Shoppe

The code in src executes user actions on https://fruitshoppe.firebaseapp.com/ for the scenarios that are marked as isAutomated =Y on the test plan excel file.

I am printing the browser console logs when executing the tests, but for some reason, the script steps from fs recorder are not being printed. 
I have tried many different things to get it to print, but remain unable to do so.
