# The_Fruit_Shoppe

The code in src executes user actions on https://fruitshoppe.firebaseapp.com/ for the scenarios that are marked as isAutomated =Y on the test plan excel file.

I am printing the browser console logs when executing the tests, but for some reason, the script steps from fs recorder are not being printed. 
I have tried many different things to get it to print, but remain unable to do so. If user actions can somehow be printed, then assertions can be done to look for expected user actions as part of final script. 


Please make sure that dependencies in pom file are loaded  and Chrome browser is installed prior to running selenium tests.
